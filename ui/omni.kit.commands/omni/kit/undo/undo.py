        # whether the command is being executed, undone, or redone. Secondly, groups
        # of commands will generate individual callbacks when originally executed or
        # redone, but only a single callback for the entire group when it is undone.
        #
        # Another confusing aspect of these on_change callbacks is that there is an
        # identically named API exposed via the 'omni.kit.commands' module which is
        # used to notify subscribers when a command is registered, deregistered, or
        # added to the command history (which is distinct from the undo/redo stack).
        #
        # Ideally we should clean up both of these APIs, but there is existing code
        # that depends on the existing behaviour. There have been discussions about
        # deprecating this entire 'omni.kit.undo' module in favour of new APIs that
        # are exposed through 'omni.kit.commands' instead, which may be a good time
