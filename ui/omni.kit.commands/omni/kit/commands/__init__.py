"""Commands for Omniverse Kit.

:mod:`omni.kit.commands` module is used to register and execute **Commands**. It is built on top of :mod:`omni.kit.undo` module to enable undo/redo operations with **Commands**.

**Command** is any class with ``do()`` method and optionally ``undo()`` method. If **Command** has ``undo()`` method it is put on the undo stack when executed.
It must be inherited from :class:`Command` class for type checking.

Example of creating your command, registering it, passing arguments and undoing.

        def do(self):
            self._bar.append('orange')

        def undo(self):
            del self._bar[-1]
