It is not supposed to be instantiated directly. Instead, the user should subclass it to create a new model.
    The item model doesn't return the data itself. Instead, it returns the value model that can contain any data type and supports callbacks. Thus the client of the model can track the changes in both the item model and any value it holds.

            `image_width : float`
                This property holds the width of the image widget. Do not use this function to find the width of the image.

            `image_height : float`
                This property holds the height of the image widget. Do not use this function to find the height of the image.

            `spacing : float`
                Sets a non-stretchable space in points between image and text.

            `clicked_fn : Callable[[], None]`
                Sets the function that will be called when when the button is activated (i.e., pressed down then released while the mouse cursor is inside the button).

            `width : ui.Length`
                This property holds the width of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the width of a screen.

            `height : ui.Length`
                This property holds the height of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the height of a screen.

            `name : str`
                The name of the widget that user can set.

            `style_type_name_override : str`
                By default, we use typeName to look up the style. But sometimes it's necessary to use a custom name. For example, when a widget is a part of another widget. (Label is a part of Button) This property can override the name to use in style.

            `identifier : str`
                An optional identifier of the widget we can use to refer to it in queries.

            `visible : bool`
                This property holds whether the widget is visible.

            `visibleMin : float`
                If the current zoom factor and DPI is less than this value, the widget is not visible.

            `visibleMax : float`
                If the current zoom factor and DPI is bigger than this value, the widget is not visible.

            `tooltip : str`

            `tooltip_offset_y : float`
                Set the Y tooltip offset in points. In a normal state, the tooltip position is linked to the mouse position. If the tooltip offset is non zero, the top left corner of the tooltip is linked to the top left corner of the widget, and this property defines the relative position the tooltip should be shown.

            `enabled : bool`
                This property holds whether the widget is enabled. In general an enabled widget handles keyboard and mouse events; a disabled widget does not. And widgets display themselves differently when they are disabled.

            `selected : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eSelected state of the style.

            `checked : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eChecked state of the style. It's on the Widget level because the button can have sub-widgets that are also should be checked.

            `dragging : bool`
                This property holds if the widget is being dragged.

            `opaque_for_mouse_events : bool`
                If the widgets has callback functions it will by default not capture the events if it is the top most widget and setup this option to true, so they don't get routed to the child widgets either

            `skip_draw_when_clipped : bool`
                The flag that specifies if it's necessary to bypass the whole draw cycle if the bounding box is clipped with a scrolling frame. It's needed to avoid the limitation of 65535 primitives in a single draw list.

            `mouse_moved_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user moves the mouse inside the widget. Mouse move events only occur if a mouse button is pressed while the mouse is being moved. void onMouseMoved(float x, float y, int32_t modifier)

            `mouse_pressed_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user presses the mouse button inside the widget.

            `mouse_double_clicked_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user presses the mouse button twice inside the widget. The function specification is the same as in setMousePressedFn. void onMouseDoubleClicked(float x, float y, int32_t button, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier)

            `mouse_wheel_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user uses mouse wheel on the focused window. The function specification is the same as in setMousePressedFn. void onMouseWheel(float x, float y, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier)

            `build_header_fn : `
                Set dynamic header that will be created dynamiclly when it is needed. The function is called inside a ui.Frame scope that the widget will be parented correctly.

            `collapsed_changed_fn : `
                The state of the CollapsableFrame.

            `horizontal_clipping : `
                When the content of the frame is bigger than the frame the exceeding part is not drawn if the clipping is on. It only works for horizontal direction.

            `vertical_clipping : `
                When the content of the frame is bigger than the frame the exceeding part is not drawn if the clipping is on. It only works for vertial direction.

            `separate_window : `
                A special mode where the child is placed to the transparent borderless window. We need it to be able to place the UI to the exact stacking order between other windows.

            `raster_policy : `
                Determine how the content of the frame should be rasterized.

            `build_fn : `
                Set the callback that will be called once the frame is visible and the content of the callback will override the frame child. It's useful for lazy load.

            `width : ui.Length`
                This property holds the width of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the width of a screen.

            `height : ui.Length`
                This property holds the height of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the height of a screen.

            `name : str`
                The name of the widget that user can set.

            `style_type_name_override : str`
                By default, we use typeName to look up the style. But sometimes it's necessary to use a custom name. For example, when a widget is a part of another widget. (Label is a part of Button) This property can override the name to use in style.

            `identifier : str`
                An optional identifier of the widget we can use to refer to it in queries.

            `visible : bool`

            `style_type_name_override : str`
                By default, we use typeName to look up the style. But sometimes it's necessary to use a custom name. For example, when a widget is a part of another widget. (Label is a part of Button) This property can override the name to use in style.

            `identifier : str`
                An optional identifier of the widget we can use to refer to it in queries.

            `visible : bool`

                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eSelected state of the style.

            `checked : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eChecked state of the style. It's on the Widget level because the button can have sub-widgets that are also should be checked.

                This property holds if the widget is being dragged.

            `opaque_for_mouse_events : bool`
                If the widgets has callback functions it will by default not capture the events if it is the top most widget and setup this option to true, so they don't get routed to the child widgets either

            `skip_draw_when_clipped : bool`
                The flag that specifies if it's necessary to bypass the whole draw cycle if the bounding box is clipped with a scrolling frame. It's needed to avoid the limitation of 65535 primitives in a single draw list.

            `mouse_moved_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user moves the mouse inside the widget. Mouse move events only occur if a mouse button is pressed while the mouse is being moved. void onMouseMoved(float x, float y, int32_t modifier)

            `mouse_pressed_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user presses the mouse button inside the widget. The function should be like this: void onMousePressed(float x, float y, int32_t button, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier) Where 'button' is the number of the mouse button pressed. 'modifier' is the flag for the keyboard modifier key.

            `mouse_released_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user releases the mouse button if this button was pressed inside the widget. void onMouseReleased(float x, float y, int32_t button, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier)

            `mouse_double_clicked_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user presses the mouse button twice inside the widget. The function specification is the same as in setMousePressedFn. void onMouseDoubleClicked(float x, float y, int32_t button, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier)

            `mouse_wheel_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user uses mouse wheel on the focused window. The function specification is the same as in setMousePressedFn. void onMouseWheel(float x, float y, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier)

            `mouse_hovered_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user use mouse enter/leave on the focused window. function specification is the same as in setMouseHovedFn. void onMouseHovered(bool hovered)

            `drag_fn : Callable`
                Specify that this Widget is draggable, and set the callback that is attached to the drag operation.

        ### Keyword Arguments:

            `direction : `
                This type is used to determine the direction of the layout. If the Stack's orientation is eLeftToRight the widgets are placed in a horizontal row, from left to right. If the Stack's orientation is eRightToLeft the widgets are placed in a horizontal row, from right to left. If the Stack's orientation is eTopToBottom, the widgets are placed in a vertical column, from top to bottom. If the Stack's orientation is eBottomToTop, the widgets are placed in a vertical column, from bottom to top. If the Stack's orientation is eBackToFront, the widgets are placed sorted in a Z-order in top right corner. If the Stack's orientation is eFrontToBack, the widgets are placed sorted in a Z-order in top right corner, the first widget goes to front.

            `content_clipping : `
                Determines if the child widgets should be clipped by the rectangle of this Stack.

            `spacing : `
                Sets a non-stretchable space in pixels between child items of this layout.

            `send_mouse_events_to_back : `
                When children of a Z-based stack overlap mouse events are normally sent to the topmost one. Setting this property true will invert that behavior, sending mouse events to the bottom-most child.

            `width : ui.Length`
                This property holds the width of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the width of a screen.

            `height : ui.Length`
                This property holds the height of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the height of a screen.

            `name : str`
                The name of the widget that user can set.

            `style_type_name_override : str`
                By default, we use typeName to look up the style. But sometimes it's necessary to use a custom name. For example, when a widget is a part of another widget. (Label is a part of Button) This property can override the name to use in style.

            `identifier : str`
                An optional identifier of the widget we can use to refer to it in queries.

            `visible : bool`
                This property holds whether the widget is visible.

            `visibleMin : float`
                If the current zoom factor and DPI is less than this value, the widget is not visible.

            `visibleMax : float`
                If the current zoom factor and DPI is bigger than this value, the widget is not visible.

            `tooltip : str`
                Set a basic tooltip for the widget, this will simply be a Label, it will follow the Tooltip style

            `tooltip_fn : Callable`
                Set dynamic tooltip that will be created dynamiclly the first time it is needed. the function is called inside a ui.Frame scope that the widget will be parented correctly.

            `tooltip_offset_x : float`
                Set the X tooltip offset in points. In a normal state, the tooltip position is linked to the mouse position. If the tooltip offset is non zero, the top left corner of the tooltip is linked to the top left corner of the widget, and this property defines the relative position the tooltip should be shown.

            `tooltip_offset_y : float`
                Set the Y tooltip offset in points. In a normal state, the tooltip position is linked to the mouse position. If the tooltip offset is non zero, the top left corner of the tooltip is linked to the top left corner of the widget, and this property defines the relative position the tooltip should be shown.

            `enabled : bool`
                This property holds whether the widget is enabled. In general an enabled widget handles keyboard and mouse events; a disabled widget does not. And widgets display themselves differently when they are disabled.

            `selected : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eSelected state of the style.

            `checked : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eChecked state of the style. It's on the Widget level because the button can have sub-widgets that are also should be checked.

            `width : ui.Length`
                This property holds the width of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the width of a screen.

            `height : ui.Length`
                This property holds the height of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the height of a screen.

            `name : str`
                The name of the widget that user can set.

            `style_type_name_override : str`
                By default, we use typeName to look up the style. But sometimes it's necessary to use a custom name. For example, when a widget is a part of another widget. (Label is a part of Button) This property can override the name to use in style.

            `identifier : str`
                An optional identifier of the widget we can use to refer to it in queries.

            `visible : bool`
                This property holds whether the widget is visible.

            `visibleMin : float`
                If the current zoom factor and DPI is less than this value, the widget is not visible.

            `visibleMax : float`
                If the current zoom factor and DPI is bigger than this value, the widget is not visible.

            `tooltip : str`
                Set a basic tooltip for the widget, this will simply be a Label, it will follow the Tooltip style

            `tooltip_fn : Callable`
                Set dynamic tooltip that will be created dynamiclly the first time it is needed. the function is called inside a ui.Frame scope that the widget will be parented correctly.

            `tooltip_offset_x : float`
                Set the X tooltip offset in points. In a normal state, the tooltip position is linked to the mouse position. If the tooltip offset is non zero, the top left corner of the tooltip is linked to the top left corner of the widget, and this property defines the relative position the tooltip should be shown.

            `tooltip_offset_y : float`
                Set the Y tooltip offset in points. In a normal state, the tooltip position is linked to the mouse position.

            `enabled : bool`
                This property holds whether the widget is enabled. In general an enabled widget handles keyboard and mouse events; a disabled widget does not. And widgets display themselves differently when they are disabled.

            `selected : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eSelected state of the style.

            `checked : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eChecked state of the style. It's on the Widget level because the button can have sub-widgets that are also should be checked.

            `dragging : bool`
                This property holds if the widget is being dragged.

            `opaque_for_mouse_events : bool`
                If the widgets has callback functions it will by default not capture the events if it is the top most widget and setup this option to true, so they don't get routed to the child widgets either

                The flag that specifies if it's necessary to bypass the whole draw cycle if the bounding box is clipped with a scrolling frame. It's needed to avoid the limitation of 65535 primitives in a single draw list.

            `mouse_moved_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user moves the mouse inside the widget. Mouse move events only occur if a mouse button is pressed while the mouse is being moved. void onMouseMoved(float x, float y, int32_t modifier)

            `mouse_pressed_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user presses the mouse button inside the widget. The function should be like this: void onMousePressed(float x, float y, int32_t button, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier) Where 'button' is the number of the mouse button pressed.

                This property holds the width of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the width of a screen.

            `height : ui.Length`
                This property holds the height of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the height of a screen.

            `name : str`
                The name of the widget that user can set.

            `style_type_name_override : str`
                By default, we use typeName to look up the style. But sometimes it's necessary to use a custom name. For example, when a widget is a part of another widget. (Label is a part of Button) This property can override the name to use in style.

            `identifier : str`
                An optional identifier of the widget we can use to refer to it in queries.

        ### Keyword Arguments:

            `direction : `
                This type is used to determine the direction of the layout. If the Stack's orientation is eLeftToRight the widgets are placed in a horizontal row, from left to right. If the Stack's orientation is eRightToLeft the widgets are placed in a horizontal row, from right to left. If the Stack's orientation is eTopToBottom, the widgets are placed in a vertical column, from top to bottom. If the Stack's orientation is eBottomToTop, the widgets are placed in a vertical column, from bottom to top. If the Stack's orientation is eBackToFront, the widgets are placed sorted in a Z-order in top right corner. If the Stack's orientation is eFrontToBack, the widgets are placed sorted in a Z-order in top right corner, the first widget goes to front.

            `content_clipping : `
                Determines if the child widgets should be clipped by the rectangle of this Stack.

            `spacing : `
                Sets a non-stretchable space in pixels between child items of this layout.

            `send_mouse_events_to_back : `
                When children of a Z-based stack overlap mouse events are normally sent to the topmost one. Setting this property true will invert that behavior, sending mouse events to the bottom-most child.

            `width : ui.Length`
                This property holds the width of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the width of a screen.

    TreeView is a widget that presents a hierarchical view of information. Each item can have a number of subitems. An indentation often visualizes this in a list. An item can be expanded to reveal subitems, if any exist, and collapsed to hide subitems.
    TreeView can be used in file manager applications, where it allows the user to navigate the file system directories. They are also used to present hierarchical data, such as the scene object hierarchy.
    TreeView uses a model/view pattern to manage the relationship between data and the way it is presented. The separation of functionality gives developers greater flexibility to customize the presentation of items and provides a standard interface to allow a wide range of data sources to be used with other widgets.
    TreeView is responsible for the presentation of model data to the user and processing user input. To allow some flexibility in the way the data is presented, the creation of the sub-widgets is performed by the delegate. It provides the ability to customize any sub-item of TreeView.

            `style_type_name_override : str`
                By default, we use typeName to look up the style. But sometimes it's necessary to use a custom name. For example, when a widget is a part of another widget. (Label is a part of Button) This property can override the name to use in style.

            `identifier : str`
                An optional identifier of the widget we can use to refer to it in queries.

        ### Keyword Arguments:

            `direction : `
                This type is used to determine the direction of the layout. If the Stack's orientation is eLeftToRight the widgets are placed in a horizontal row, from left to right. If the Stack's orientation is eRightToLeft the widgets are placed in a horizontal row, from right to left. If the Stack's orientation is eTopToBottom, the widgets are placed in a vertical column, from top to bottom. If the Stack's orientation is eBottomToTop, the widgets are placed in a vertical column, from bottom to top. If the Stack's orientation is eBackToFront, the widgets are placed sorted in a Z-order in top right corner. If the Stack's orientation is eFrontToBack, the widgets are placed sorted in a Z-order in top right corner, the first widget goes to front.

            `content_clipping : `
                Determines if the child widgets should be clipped by the rectangle of this Stack.

            `spacing : `
                Sets a non-stretchable space in pixels between child items of this layout.

            `send_mouse_events_to_back : `
                When children of a Z-based stack overlap mouse events are normally sent to the topmost one. Setting this property true will invert that behavior, sending mouse events to the bottom-most child.

            `width : ui.Length`
                This property holds the width of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the width of a screen.

            `height : ui.Length`
                This property holds the height of the widget relative to its parent. Do not use this function to find the height of a screen.

            `name : str`
                The name of the widget that user can set.

            `style_type_name_override : str`
                By default, we use typeName to look up the style. But sometimes it's necessary to use a custom name. For example, when a widget is a part of another widget. (Label is a part of Button) This property can override the name to use in style.

            `identifier : str`
                An optional identifier of the widget we can use to refer to it in queries.

            `visible : bool`
                This property holds whether the widget is visible.

            `visibleMin : float`
                If the current zoom factor and DPI is less than this value, the widget is not visible.

            `visibleMax : float`
                If the current zoom factor and DPI is bigger than this value, the widget is not visible.

            `tooltip : str`
                Set a basic tooltip for the widget, this will simply be a Label, it will follow the Tooltip style

            `tooltip_fn : Callable`
                Set dynamic tooltip that will be created dynamiclly the first time it is needed. the function is called inside a ui.Frame scope that the widget will be parented correctly.

            `tooltip_offset_x : float`
                Set the X tooltip offset in points. In a normal state, the tooltip position is linked to the mouse position. If the tooltip offset is non zero, the top left corner of the tooltip is linked to the top left corner of the widget, and this property defines the relative position the tooltip should be shown.

            `tooltip_offset_y : float`
                Set the Y tooltip offset in points. In a normal state, the tooltip position is linked to the mouse position. If the tooltip offset is non zero, the top left corner of the tooltip is linked to the top left corner of the widget, and this property defines the relative position the tooltip should be shown.

            `enabled : bool`
                This property holds whether the widget is enabled. In general an enabled widget handles keyboard and mouse events; a disabled widget does not. And widgets display themselves differently when they are disabled.

            `selected : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eSelected state of the style.

            `checked : bool`
                This property holds a flag that specifies the widget has to use eChecked state of the style. It's on the Widget level because the button can have sub-widgets that are also should be checked.

            `dragging : bool`
                This property holds if the widget is being dragged.

            `opaque_for_mouse_events : bool`
                If the widgets has callback functions it will by default not capture the events if it is the top most widget and setup this option to true, so they don't get routed to the child widgets either

            `skip_draw_when_clipped : bool`
                The flag that specifies if it's necessary to bypass the whole draw cycle if the bounding box is clipped with a scrolling frame. It's needed to avoid the limitation of 65535 primitives in a single draw list.

            `mouse_moved_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user moves the mouse inside the widget. Mouse move events only occur if a mouse button is pressed while the mouse is being moved. void onMouseMoved(float x, float y, int32_t modifier)

            `mouse_pressed_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user presses the mouse button inside the widget. The function should be like this: void onMousePressed(float x, float y, int32_t button, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier) Where 'button' is the number of the mouse button pressed. 'modifier' is the flag for the keyboard modifier key.

            `mouse_released_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user releases the mouse button if this button was pressed inside the widget. void onMouseReleased(float x, float y, int32_t button, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier)

            `mouse_double_clicked_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user presses the mouse button twice inside the widget. The function specification is the same as in setMousePressedFn. void onMouseDoubleClicked(float x, float y, int32_t button, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier)

            `mouse_wheel_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user uses mouse wheel on the focused window. The function specification is the same as in setMousePressedFn. void onMouseWheel(float x, float y, carb::input::KeyboardModifierFlags modifier)

            `mouse_hovered_fn : Callable`
                Sets the function that will be called when the user use mouse enter/leave on the focused window. function specification is the same as in setMouseHovedFn. void onMouseHovered(bool hovered)

            `drag_fn : Callable`
                Specify that this Widget is draggable, and set the callback that is attached to the drag operation.

            `accept_drop_fn : Callable`
                Specify that this Widget can accept specific drops and set the callback that is called to check if the drop can be accepted.

            `drop_fn : Callable`
                Specify that this Widget accepts drops and set the callback to the drop operation.

            `computed_content_size_changed_fn : Callable`
                Called when the size of the widget is changed.
